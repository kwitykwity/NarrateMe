# NarrateMe

**Turn a written story into a narrated, illustrated, multi-scene presentation — automatically, in under a minute.**

NarrateMe helps teachers and parents of kids in grades 1–3 turn any plain written story into an engaging, illustrated, narrated presentation, without needing any design, illustration, or audio-production skills. Paste a story in, and NarrateMe splits it into scenes, illustrates each one, narrates it with a warm voice, and plays it back as a simple, read-along presentation.

## Status

**MVP Sprint v1 — 2-week build.** This is a proof-of-concept build meant to demo the core pipeline end-to-end. It is not a production product. See [Non-Goals](#non-goals-v1) below for what's intentionally out of scope right now.

### Implementation Status

**Working today:**
- Story input UI — paste/type, sample stories, 50-character minimum
- Scene splitting via Claude → structured JSON with a persistent character description reused across scenes
- Per-scene illustration via an OpenAI image model, using the shared character prompt for consistency
- Per-scene narration via ElevenLabs, returned as an inline audio player on each scene card
- Concurrent generation — images and narration each run through a bounded worker pool (max 3 in flight) with a per-scene retry and a visible error state on final failure
- Presentation player — scene cards (illustration + text + narration audio), Previous/Next navigation, live image and narration progress
- Backend hardening — request timeouts (60s scenes / 120s images / 60s narration), structured logging, API-key validation, `504` on timeout

**Not yet built (still in v1 scope):**
- Word highlighting synced to narration audio
- Static / 2-pose avatar synced to audio playback
- Auto-advance playback
- Pre-generated backup story for demo resilience

**Known gap:** OpenAI's per-image latency is highly variable (~40s nominal, but can climb past the 120s backend timeout under throttling). Generation is now concurrent (capped at 3), so total time scales with the slowest image rather than the sum; a slow outlier returns `504`, after which the frontend retries once and, if that also fails, shows a per-scene error card.

## How It Works

1. **Input** — User pastes or types a story into a text box. No login required.
2. **Scene splitting** — An LLM (Claude/GPT) splits the story into 3–5 scenes (beginning/middle/end structure) and outputs structured JSON, including a persistent character description reused across every scene.
3. **Illustration** — DALL-E 3 generates one illustration per scene, using the shared character description to keep the character visually consistent.
4. **Narration** — ElevenLabs generates narration audio per scene using a warm voice ("Sarah") suited to early readers, returned as a base64 MP3 and played inline on each scene card.
5. **Playback** — A simple presentation player shows each scene's illustration alongside its text and a narration audio player, advanced scene by scene with Previous/Next controls. Narration-synced word highlighting, auto-advance, and a static/2-pose avatar are *planned*.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tool |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind CSS 4 |
| Backend / Orchestration | Python (FastAPI), Uvicorn, async clients |
| Scene generation | Anthropic Claude (structured JSON output) |
| Image generation | OpenAI image model (returns base64 PNG) |
| Text-to-Speech | ElevenLabs (`AsyncElevenLabs`, returns base64 MP3) |
| Avatar | Static image / 2-pose swap *(planned — not yet integrated)* |
| Hosting | Vercel (frontend) + Railway (backend) |
| Storage | None required for MVP — stateless, one-shot generation |

---

## Getting Started

### Backend (FastAPI)

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows  (use: source venv/bin/activate on macOS/Linux)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create `backend/.env`:

```
API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key
```

Run the API (serves on `http://localhost:8000`):

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Endpoints:** `GET /health`, `POST /api/scenes` (split story → scenes), `POST /api/images` (prompt → illustration), `POST /api/audio` (text → narration MP3).

### Frontend (Next.js)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. The frontend defaults to the backend at
`http://localhost:8000`. To point it elsewhere, copy `frontend/.env.example` to
`frontend/.env.local` and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.

---

## Deployment

The two halves deploy separately: the FastAPI backend to **Railway** (an always-on
server host — the image/narration calls run 50–120s, so serverless platforms with short
request limits won't work), and the Next.js frontend to **Vercel**. Deploy the backend
first so you have its URL for the frontend.

### 1. Backend → Railway

1. Create a new Railway project → **Deploy from GitHub repo** and select this repo.
2. In the service **Settings**, set **Root Directory** to `backend` (the app lives in a
   subdirectory).
3. Railway (Nixpacks) auto-detects `requirements.txt`. Set the **Start Command** to:
   ```
   uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
   ```
   Railway injects `$PORT`; binding `0.0.0.0` is required.
4. Add environment variables (**Variables** tab):
   - `API_KEY` — Anthropic API key (scene splitting)
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` — OpenAI key (image generation)
   - `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` — ElevenLabs key (narration)
   - *(optional)* `IMAGE_QUALITY` (`low`/`medium`/`high`, default `medium`) and
     `IMAGE_SIZE` (default `1024x1024`)
   - Leave `CORS_ORIGINS` unset for now (added in step 3 below).
   - *(optional)* pin Python via a `.python-version` file or `NIXPACKS_PYTHON_VERSION`;
     the default recent Python (3.11+) works for this code.
5. Deploy, then verify: open `https://<your-railway-domain>/health` — it should return
   `{"status":"healthy"}`.

### 2. Frontend → Vercel

1. Import the repo into Vercel and set **Root Directory** to `frontend` (Vercel
   auto-detects Next.js).
2. Add an environment variable:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` = your Railway backend URL (e.g.
     `https://<your-railway-domain>`)
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_` vars are inlined at **build time**, so set this before deploying (or
     redeploy after changing it).
3. Deploy, and note the resulting Vercel URL (e.g. `https://narrateme.vercel.app`).

### 3. Close the CORS loop

1. Back in Railway, set `CORS_ORIGINS` to your Vercel production URL
   (e.g. `https://narrateme.vercel.app`) and redeploy the backend.
   - Multiple origins are comma-separated. Vercel *preview* deploys get dynamic URLs; to
     allow those too you'd switch to `allow_origin_regex` in `backend/app/main.py` — the
     production URL alone is fine for a demo.

### 4. Smoke test

Load the Vercel site, paste a story, and confirm images and narration generate with no
CORS errors in the browser console.

## MVP Scope (Must Have)

- Text input only (no speech-to-text)
- LLM scene splitting into 3–5 scenes
- One illustration per scene (DALL-E 3, consistent character prompt)
- TTS narration per scene
- Simple presentation player (image + highlighted text + auto-advance)
- Static or 2-pose avatar synced to audio playback

## Non-Goals (v1)

- Lip-sync / gesture animation
- Comprehension quizzes or vocabulary activities
- Teacher dashboard, analytics, or story library
- Background music
- Speech-to-text / audio story input
- Multi-language support

---

## Success Criteria (Demo-Ready)

- A teacher/parent can paste a story and get a playable illustrated + narrated presentation in under 60 seconds.
- The pipeline completes without manual intervention on at least 2 different test stories.
- Word highlighting stays roughly in sync with narration.
- A backup pre-generated story is ready in case live generation fails during the demo.

---

## Known Risk

**Character consistency across scenes** — DALL-E-generated illustrations may drift in the character's appearance between scenes. Mitigation for this build is a strong, persistent character-description prompt reused in every image generation call — not a technical/model-level fix. This is flagged as future work rather than solved in the 2-week build.

---

## Timeline (14 Days)

| Days | Milestone |
|---|---|
| 1–2 | Finalize scope, set up repo/API keys, each person validates their API call in isolation |
| 3–7 | Parallel build: pipeline (backend), image gen (AI), TTS (audio), player UI (frontend, against mock data) |
| 8–10 | Integration: connect pipeline end-to-end, add error/timeout handling |
| 11–12 | Polish: word-highlight sync, transitions, loading states, 1–2 pre-generated backup stories |
| 13–14 | Buffer + demo rehearsal |

---

## Future Scope (Post-Sprint)

Avatar lip-sync, comprehension quizzes, teacher dashboard, story library, voice cloning, multi-language support, background music/sound design, analytics.
