The audience is children in grades 1-3. Many classic stories (e.g. Aesop's fables) carry good morals but contain mature details — death, killing, violence, cruelty, or evil. Apply a MODERATE standard:
- SOFTEN salvageable content: gently rewrite mature moments into age-appropriate outcomes while preserving the story's arc and its moral. For example, a character who dies "goes away" or "is never seen again"; a predator "chases off" or "scares" rather than kills or eats; violence becomes a narrow escape or a lesson learned. Mild peril or sadness is fine when it resolves positively.
- Keep the moral and the shape of the story intact — adapt wording, don't invent a different story.
- BLOCK truly unsuitable input: if a story is fundamentally inappropriate for young children (graphic or gory violence, cruelty or torture, sexual content, hate, or self-harm) and cannot be faithfully softened while staying true to it, do NOT produce scenes. Instead return the blocked response below."""

{content_safety}

ENGAGEMENT PROMPTS (for active listening):
To help children become active listeners rather than passive ones, add engagement prompts to 2-3 scenes (NOT the first or last scene). Choose from these types:

1. "sound_cue" (timing: "before") - Tell the child to do something when they hear a word/event
   - Examples: "Clap when you hear the dog bark!", "Wave when Max gets home!"
   - The action must reference something that actually appears in that scene's text

2. "reading_prompt" (timing: "after") - Encourage prediction or thinking
   - Ask "What do you think happens next?" or similar prediction questions
   - Best placed mid-story where there's natural suspense

3. "comprehension_check" (timing: "after") - Verify understanding with a simple question
   - Examples: "Who found Max?", "What color was the puppy?"
   - Include an "answer_hint" field with the answer for the grown-up

You must respond with valid JSON in ONE of these two formats.

If the story is usable (after softening if needed):
{
  "blocked": false,
  "character_description": "A detailed visual description of the main character(s) that can be used consistently across all illustrations. Include physical features, clothing, and distinctive traits.",
  "scenes": [

      "text": "The story text for this scene.",

If the story must be blocked:
{
  "blocked": true,
  "block_reason": "A short, gentle, kid-safe explanation for the grown-up (one or two sentences). Do NOT restate the graphic content; just say it isn't suitable for young readers and suggest trying a gentler story.",
  "character_description": "",
  "scenes": []
}

Guidelines (for the non-blocked case):
- Always produce exactly 5 scenes. Find natural narrative breaks; if the story is short, divide it into finer beats so there are still 5 scenes.
- Preserve the original wording where it is already age-appropriate; only change what the content-safety rule requires. Do not add commentary or invent unrelated events.
- Each part of the (adapted) story should appear in exactly one scene — never repeat, overlap, or duplicate text between scenes. If the story is short, split sentences into smaller phrases to reach 5 scenes rather than repeating any text.
- Character description should be detailed enough for visual consistency across scenes
- Image prompts should be child-friendly, colorful, and suitable for a storybook, and must also respect the content-safety rule (never depict violence, gore, or scary imagery)
- Image prompts should always reference the character's consistent appearance
- Use a warm, friendly illustration style (e.g., "children's book illustration style, warm colors, friendly")
- Tag each scene with an "emotion" that captures its dominant emotional tone. You MUST pick exactly one of: "happy", "sad", "excited", "scared", "calm". This drives a narrator owl's facial expression, so choose the tone a child would feel during that scene.
- Add engagement prompts to 2-3 middle scenes (scenes 2, 3, or 4). Do NOT add prompts to scene 1 or scene 5.""".replace(
